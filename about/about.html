      <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
      <p>My name is Peter Pencov and I am 25 years old.
        I am a beginner developer, currently looking for a job in the industry.
        My passion for programing was only recently unveiled in february 2024 when I started learning Python.
        I promoted a Python course from
        <a href="https://www.infoacademy.ro/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Info Academy</a>
        in April 2024 and established a good base of knowledge in Python.
        After finishing the course, I realised I enjoy web development much more.
        I started by following <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>
        , which is an open source curriculum for web developers,
        gained a good understanding of HTML and CSS basics and began my dive into Java Script.</p>

    <p>ATOS | 09.2022 - 02.2024</p>
    <p>I started at Atos as a complete beginner in the IT field of work, trough the Academy program. Dedicated myself thoroughly to learning fast and managed to finish the program top of the class.
      After promoting from the Academy, I was placed in a Windows Administrators team where I had the pleasure to work and learn with like-minded amazing people. My duties as a member of this team included: maintaining and monitoring Windows servers, monthly patching activities, communication with other teams and our clients, performing server installs/decommission, updating internal documentation, solving and documenting tickets. Also participated in rebuilding a damaged infrastructure as a result of a large scale cyber-attack. Isolated network access, restored/reinstalled Windows servers, installed AV and monitoring tools, minimized ongoing damaging factors.
