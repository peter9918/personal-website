    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>My name is Peter Pencov and I am 25 years old.
      I am a beginner developer, currently looking for a job in the industry.
      My passion for programing was only recently unveiled in february 2024 when I started learning Python.
      I promoted a Python course from
      <a href="https://www.infoacademy.ro/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Info Academy</a>
      in April 2024 and established a good base of knowledge in Python.
      After finishing the course, I realised I enjoy web development much more.
      I started by following <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>
      , which is an open source curriculum for web developers,
      gained a good understanding of HTML and CSS basics and began my dive into Java Script.</p>
